# Must read articles

Read these before everything else, and keep them in mid when developing / contributing:

* [Bikeshed, or "the sleep(1) saga"](http://bikeshed.com/)

* [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds)

Don't worry too much about the specifics, but grasp the general idea behind them.
