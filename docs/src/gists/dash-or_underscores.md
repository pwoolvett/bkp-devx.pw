title: Dash or Underscores?
---

# This is a short one

```haiku
Variable names
or any string, for that matter,
when they contain a dash,
can be split or navigated by their parts
either by double clicking,
where you'll get a partial selection
or by moving with ++ctrl+arrow-right++
or by moving with ++ctrl+arrow-left++
where you'll move the cursor to the next part!

When they contain an underscore instead,
wont be split or navigated by their parts
neither by double clicking,
where you'll get a full word selection
nor by moving with ++ctrl+arrow-right++
nor by moving with ++ctrl+arrow-left++
where you'll move the cursor to the next word!

unless you're in `bash`,
because `readline`,
because `.xinputrc`


For python scripts filenames
both are fine,
but for modules
underscore is required
```


* `pre-commit` is a single concept, but slected/navigated as two.
* `my_children` are two words, but selected/navigated as one.
